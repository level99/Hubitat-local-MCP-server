# Tool Reference

Quick reference for all 90 MCP tools. The server exposes **35 items on `tools/list`**: 23 core tools + 12 gateway tools. Each gateway proxies additional tools — call with no args for full schemas, or with `tool` and `args` to execute.

For the most authoritative reference, call `get_tool_guide` via MCP.

## Core Tools (23) — Always visible on tools/list

### Device Tools (6)

| Tool | Description | Access Gate |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `list_devices` | List accessible devices. Pagination, `labelFilter` (substring), `capabilityFilter` (exact), `format='ids'` (flat ID array), `fields=[...]` (projection). Use `detailed=false` first, paginate `detailed=true` (limit 20-30). | None |
| `get_device` | Full device details: attributes, commands, capabilities, room. | None |
| `get_attribute` | Get specific attribute value from a device. | None |
| `send_command` | Send a command to a device (on, off, setLevel, etc.). | None |
| `get_device_events` | Recent events for a device. Default 10, recommended max 50. | None |
| `poll_until_attribute` | Block-poll an attribute until it matches `expectedValue` or any of `expectedValues` (at least one required; both may be set simultaneously, OR semantics). `timeoutMs` in MILLISECONDS (default 5000ms = 5 seconds, max 60000ms). BLOCKS the MCP request; use sparingly and prefer event-driven flows. Returns `success`, `finalValue`, `elapsedMs`, `polledCount`, `timedOut`; adds `neverReported: true` if the attribute was null throughout. Use after `send_command` to verify a state change in a single round-trip. | None |

### manage_rules_admin (5 tools)

Rule administration: delete, test, export, import, and clone rules.

| Tool | Description | Access Gate |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `custom_delete_rule` | Delete a rule (auto-backs up first). | None |
| `custom_test_rule` | Dry-run: see what would happen without executing. | None |
| `custom_export_rule` | Export rule as portable JSON. | None |
| `custom_import_rule` | Import a rule from exported JSON. | None |
| `custom_clone_rule` | Duplicate an existing rule. | None |

> **Built-in rule redirect:** `custom_get_rule`, `custom_export_rule`, `custom_update_rule`, `custom_delete_rule`, `custom_test_rule`, and `custom_clone_rule` operate only on MCP-native rules. If you pass an id belonging to a Hubitat built-in rule (Rule Machine, Room Lighting, Basic Rules, Visual Rules), the error message includes a redirect hint pointing to `manage_installed_apps -> get_app_config(appId=<id>)` (read) or, for write and delete verbs, the appropriate `manage_native_rules_and_apps` CRUD tool. The test verb hint includes `run_rm_rule` only for Rule Machine rules; other built-in rule-likes receive `get_app_config` for inspection because `run_rm_rule` is RM-only. This redirect fires only when Built-in App Tools are enabled. See `TOOL_GUIDE.md` "Hubitat Built-in Rule Redirect" for full details.

| `get_app_config` | Read an installed app's configuration page (Rule Machine, Room Lighting, Basic Rules, HPM, etc.). Returns sections/inputs/values; multi-page apps via `pageName`. Workflow: list_installed_apps or list_rm_rules -> get_app_config with appId; multi-page apps accept pageName (HPM: prefPkgUninstall for full list). Read-only. | Hub Admin Read |

| `pause_rm_rule` | Pause an RM rule (reversible; paused rules don't fire on triggers). | Built-in App Tools |
| `resume_rm_rule` | Resume a paused RM rule. | Built-in App Tools |
| `set_rm_rule_boolean` | Set an RM rule's private boolean (true or false only; string values must be lowercase `"true"`/`"false"`). | Built-in App Tools |
| `create_native_app` | Create a new empty classic SmartApp (RM 5.1 by default; `appType` enum extends to other types). Returns `appId`. | Built-in App Tools + Hub Admin Write |

### manage_mcp_self (1 tool)

Developer Mode self-administration: tools that let an LLM agent or CI/CD pipeline manage the MCP rule app's own configuration without manual UI intervention. Requires the opt-in `enableDeveloperMode` toggle in the MCP rule app settings (default OFF). Each successful write is logged at WARN level for audit. First gateway under the Developer Mode pattern — additional self-admin tools (device-access management, true Hub Variables namespace support, artifact cleanup) are planned as follow-ups under the same toggle.

| Tool | Description | Access Gate |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `update_mcp_settings` | Update one or more of the MCP rule app's own settings (toggles, log level, tuning params). Allowlisted: `mcpLogLevel`, `debugLogging`, `maxCapturedStates`, `loopGuardMax`, `loopGuardWindowSec`, `enableHubAdminRead`, `enableBuiltinApp`, `enableCustomRuleEngine`. After flipping any `enable*` toggle, MCP clients may need to reconnect to refresh their cached tool schema. | Developer Mode + Hub Admin Write + recent backup |
