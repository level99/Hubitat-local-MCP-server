Use this for default rule-creation requests. The custom_* MCP rule engine (separate surface) is only appropriate when the user EXPLICITLY wants a sandbox MCP-managed rule that does not appear in Hubitat's UI -- uncommon outside power-user / testing scenarios. QUICK FLOW for a default rule create: (1) create_native_app(appType='rule_machine', name='...', confirm=true) returns appId. (2) update_native_app(appId=N, addTrigger={capability:'Certain Time (and optional date)', time:'A specific time', atTime:'17:00'}, confirm=true). (3) update_native_app(appId=N, addAction={capability:'log', message:'...'}, confirm=true). Three calls. Each call returns settingsApplied so you can confirm the rule baked. Native rules + apps (RM rules, Room Lighting, Button Controllers, Basic Rules, Notifier, Groups+Scenes, Visual Rules -- any classic SmartApp). Two surfaces: (1) RMUtils-based runtime control for RM rules (list/run/pause/resume/setBoolean -- RM-specific because RMUtils is RM-only); (2) admin-layer CRUD that works uniformly across ALL classic SmartApps via /installedapp/* (create/update/delete by appId). Writes snapshot before every change; restore via the unified list_item_backups + restore_item_backup tools in manage_apps_drivers. Completely separate from the MCP custom rule engine (custom_* tools). Requires Built-in App Tools enabled; CRUD additionally requires Hub Admin Write. Verification protocol: write operations on RM 5.1 are asynchronous; if a response indicates a hard failure (success: false) or a partial state needing repair (partial: true, or non-empty settingsSkipped), the hub may have applied the change post-response despite the reported status -- verify via get_app_config(appId=N) and inspect persisted settings before retrying.",

  - "rule_machine" — Rule Machine 5.1 (the only registered type today; verified live)
  - Other classic SmartApps (Room Lighting, Button Controllers, Basic Rules, Notifier, Groups+Scenes, Visual Rules) use the same endpoint family — register them in _appTypeRegistry to enable creation. Update and delete already work on them via update_native_app / delete_native_app with their appId.

This is COMPLETELY SEPARATE from the MCP custom rule engine (custom_list_rules / custom_create_rule). Use create_native_app for native automations that show up in the hub UI; use custom_create_rule for MCP-managed rules.

Workflow: create_native_app(appType=\"rule_machine\", name=\"...\") → get_app_config(appId) to read the page schema → update_native_app(appId, settings={...}) to add triggers/conditions/actions. Each update_native_app call auto-backs-up first, enforces the multiple=true capability contract, and verifies post-write that the app still renders cleanly.

Optional `triggers` array: pass a list of trigger specs and the tool creates the rule + adds every trigger + fires updateRule in a single call. Each trigger spec follows the same shape update_native_app's `addTrigger` parameter accepts (capability + capability-specific fields). Use this when you know all the triggers up-front; for incremental editing use update_native_app(addTrigger=…) instead.

Optional `actions` array: same pattern but for actions (each item shaped like update_native_app's `addAction` parameter).

PARTIAL-SUCCESS HANDLING (important for LLM drivers): the tool ALWAYS creates the rule shell (you get an `appId` back) even if some triggers/actions fail to fully bake. Inspect the result:
  - `partial: true` + `partialTriggers: [N, ...]` / `partialActions: [N, ...]` → some pieces are incomplete (this includes any per-item result with `partial: true` OR `success: false`)
  - `repairHints: [...]` → concrete next-step instructions
  - Each per-trigger / per-action result has its own `success`, `partial`, `settingsSkipped`, `repairHints`, and `health` block. `success: true, partial: true` on an inner result means the row was written but needs repair.
The right move when `partial: true` is to follow the repairHints, NOT to delete the rule and retry from scratch. Tool-only repair via update_native_app(walkStep={...}) / replaceActions / removeAction can usually finish the job. Only declare failure after exhausting those repair attempts.

Same endpoint family across all of them, so this one tool covers writes to any classic SmartApp instance addressed by appId. Two modes (provide settings, button, or both):

settings: Map of {inputName: value}. Values: scalars for bool/enum/text/number inputs, List of device IDs for capability.* multi-device inputs. The multiple=true 3-field contract (settings[name]=csv + name.type=capability.X + name.multiple=true) is emitted automatically — you don't need to think about it. Post-write verification checks that the multiple flag survived; one automatic retry on divergence.

button: page-transition button name (e.g. \"editCond\", \"editAct\", \"pausRule\", \"updateRule\", \"refreshActions\" for RM; equivalent buttons exist for other app types — discover via get_app_config).

pageName: optional — target a specific sub-page whose schema drives the settings marshaling. Defaults to the app's main page.

stateAttribute: optional string passed with the button click (e.g., RM uses this for editCond/editAct to identify which trigger/action).

BEFORE EVERY WRITE: a full snapshot (configure/json + statusJson) is saved to File Manager. Response includes backup.backupKey for use with restore_item_backup (in manage_apps_drivers) if the write goes wrong.

Auto-updateRule: main-page settings writes are followed by an implicit updateRule button click so initialize() re-fires. Sub-page writes (pageName=selectTriggers, selectActions, etc.) skip the auto-click so the wizard's stateAttribute (moreCond, editCond, editAct, ...) survives — commit the wizard via its own Done button (RM triggers: hasAll; RM actions: actionDone) and issue a final update_native_app(button='updateRule') to re-initialize.

Wizard-Done auto-finalize: clicking hasAll on selectTriggers commits the trigger to the rule's summary row but RM 5.1 leaves a single residual `isCondTrig.<N>` ("Conditional Trigger?") prompt on the page. This tool auto-writes `isCondTrig.<N>=false` after the click to clear the prompt without consuming an extra trigger index. Reported in the response as wizardDoneAutoRetry: 'OK' / 'OK after finalize ...' / 'WARN: ...'. (Earlier versions clicked hasAll twice instead, which inadvertently allocated phantom "**Broken Trigger**" rows; the finalize-via-isCondTrig path keeps trigger indices contiguous: 1, 2, 3 instead of 1, 3, 5.)

RM 5.1 trigger flow (example — adding a multi-device switch trigger via raw settings/button mode):
  1. update_native_app(appId, button='true', stateAttribute='moreCond', pageName='selectTriggers') — opens the trigger editor.
  2. update_native_app(appId, settings={tCapab1: 'Switch'}, pageName='selectTriggers') — picks the capability; page re-renders with the device picker.
  3. update_native_app(appId, settings={tDev1: [<deviceId>, ...]}, pageName='selectTriggers') — writes devices (multi-device 3-field contract is automatic).
  4. update_native_app(appId, settings={tstate1: 'on'}, pageName='selectTriggers') — sets the attribute/value.
  5. update_native_app(appId, button='hasAll', pageName='selectTriggers') — commits the trigger; the residual Conditional? prompt is auto-finalized.
  6. update_native_app(appId, button='updateRule') — re-initialize so subscriptions populate.

NOTE: the addTrigger={...} shortcut handles steps 1-6 automatically (including the updateRule at the end). Only the raw settings/button flow above requires the explicit step 6 call.

Adding a second trigger uses the SAME flow with index 2 (tCapab2, tDev2, tstate2), then a third uses index 3, etc. After the auto-finalize fix the indices are sequential.

Common values: Switch, Motion, Contact, Time, Periodic Schedule, Mode, Custom Attribute. Pass {discover: true} to get the full structured schema.". Pass `addTrigger: {discover: true}` to get a structured per-capability schema Map (returns immediately -- no hub mutation, no confirm/backup required). Common capabilities: Switch, Motion, Contact, Lock, Presence, Certain Time (and optional date), Periodic Schedule, Mode, Custom Attribute, Battery, Temperature, Button -- full list below. The tool orchestrates the full RM 5.1 wizard internally -- discovers next index, opens editor, walks the schema-aware writes, commits via hasAll, and auto-finalizes the residual isCondTrig prompt. Returns the assigned trigger index in result.triggerIndex. updateRule fires automatically after the commit so subscriptions populate immediately -- no separate button call needed. (Bulk addTriggers[] fires updateRule once at the end of the batch.)

Capability families and the spec fields each accepts:
  - Device-state (Switch / Motion / Contact / Lock / Garage / Door / Valve / Window Shade / Presence / Power source):
    capability, deviceIds, state ('on', 'active', 'open', 'unlocked', etc.)
  - Multi-device 'all of these': add allOfThese=true to the device-state spec
  - Numeric (Temperature / Humidity / Battery / Illuminance / Power / Energy / CO2 / Dimmer / Thermostat setpoints):
    capability, deviceIds, comparator ('=', '<', '>', '<=', '>=', '*changed*'), value
  - Button (Button capability):
    capability='Button', deviceIds, buttonNumber, state ('pushed' | 'held' | 'doubleTapped' | 'released')
  - Custom Attribute (any device's non-built-in attribute):
    capability='Custom Attribute', deviceIds, attribute (the attribute name), comparator, value
  - And-stays sticky modifier (works on any device-state or numeric trigger):
    add andStays={hours, minutes, seconds} to the spec
  - Time / Sunrise / Sunset (Certain Time and optional date):
    capability='Certain Time (and optional date)', time ('A specific time' | 'Sunrise' | 'Sunset'), atTime — see SEMANTIC choice below; offset (minutes for sunrise/sunset)
       atTime SEMANTIC: 'HH:mm' form (e.g. '17:00') = DAILY-recurring trigger that fires every day at that wall-clock time; full ISO datetime (e.g. '2026-04-29T17:00:00' or '2026-04-29T17:00:00.000-0500') = ONE-SHOT dated trigger that fires once on that specific date. Forms without timezone are auto-normalized to hub local tz; explicit-offset and Zulu forms are normalized to UTC equivalent.
  - Mode (hub mode change trigger):
    capability='Mode', state='Night' OR state=['Away','Night'] (mode names, case-insensitive)
    OR modeIds=['3'] OR modeIds=['3','5'] (IDs directly, from get_modes).
    IMPORTANT: writes modesX<N> internally -- do NOT pass tstate or rawSettings.tstate for Mode triggers (silently ignored; trigger renders as Broken Trigger). Use get_modes to list valid mode names/IDs.
  - Periodic Schedule (recurring schedule via the dedicated periodic sub-page):
    capability='Periodic Schedule', periodic={frequency: 'Hourly'|'Daily'|'Cron String'|...,
      everyN: <int>,           // for "every N <unit>" mode (Hourly/Daily)
      startingTime: 'HH:mm',   // start-time for everyN modes
      weekdaysOnly: <bool>,    // Daily-only
      selectedHours: [9,12],   // Hourly-only, alternative to everyN
      selectedDaysOfMonth: [1,15], // Daily-only, alternative to everyN/weekdays
      minutesOffset: <int>,    // Hourly-only, when not using everyN (startingHCX1)
      cronString: '0 * * * *', // Cron String mode
      rawSettings: {…}         // escape hatch for periodic-page fields not yet mapped
    }
    Without `periodic`, RM commits a phantom row with description="?". The tool walks the periodic sub-page (whichPeriod1 → everyN/select → time → Done) so the trigger description bakes correctly.

Optional fields on every spec:
  - conditional (default false) — sets isCondTrig.<N>=true. Combine with `condition` below to bind the conditional-trigger gate in one call; or set conditional=true alone to leave the gate empty for later.
  - condition — Map matching the addRequiredExpression per-condition shape: {capability, deviceIds?, state?, comparator?, value?, attribute?, not?, rawSettings?}. When provided, addTrigger drives the conditional-trigger sub-wizard (rCapab_<N> / rDev_<N> / state_<N> / hasAll) inline; you do NOT need separate update_native_app calls. `conditional` is implied true when `condition` is set. Note: for capability='Custom Attribute', both `attribute` AND `comparator` are required together.
  - rawSettings — escape hatch dict {fieldName: value} for advanced fields not yet mapped (e.g. ButtontDev<N> overrides, alternative attribute pickers, etc.)

Trigger index is auto-assigned (next available). The wizard's auto-finalize via isCondTrig.<N>=false fires unless conditional=true. One add_trigger call replaces the 6-8 calls of the manual wizard flow.

PARTIAL-SUCCESS HANDLING: `success: true` means the API call completed and at least one setting was written to the rule (the trigger skeleton exists). `success: false` means a hard failure -- API errored or nothing was written at all. `partial: true` is ORTHOGONAL to success and means some caller-requested fields didn't land OR the row carries a *BROKEN* marker. A `success: true, partial: true` result is the normal partial-success state -- the trigger row exists, but needs repair. The result includes `repairHints` with concrete next steps. Common repair: pass missing capability-specific fields via rawSettings={fieldName: value, ...} and re-add the trigger, OR use update_native_app(walkStep={page:'selectTriggers', operation:'introspect'}) to see what fields are live and write them one at a time. Don't treat `partial: true` as failure -- exhaust tool-only repair before declaring failure."""

  }
RM 5.1 spec: AND/OR/XOR have equal precedence, evaluated left-to-right.

Per-condition spec fields:
  - capability — required. RM's STPage capability list: 'Switch', 'Motion', 'Contact', 'Lock', 'Presence', 'Smoke detector', 'Water sensor', 'Tamper alert', 'Acceleration', 'Carbon monoxide detector', 'Carbon dioxide sensor', 'Power source', 'Mode', 'Private Boolean', 'Custom Attribute', 'Battery', 'Dimmer', 'Energy meter', 'Fan Speed', 'Humidity', 'Illuminance', 'Power meter', 'Temperature', 'Thermostat cool setpoint', 'Thermostat fan mode', 'Thermostat heat setpoint', 'Thermostat mode', 'Thermostat state', 'Window Shade', 'Days of week', 'Between two dates', 'Between two times', 'On a Day', 'Last Event Device', 'Lock codes'.
  - deviceIds — required for capability.* device types (Switch / Motion / Contact / Lock / Temperature / etc.). Omit for non-device capabilities (Mode, Private Boolean, time-based).
  - state — enum value matching the capability ('on'/'off' for Switch, 'active'/'inactive' for Motion, 'open'/'closed' for Contact, 'locked'/'unlocked' for Lock, 'present'/'not present' for Presence, 'true'/'false' for Private Boolean, etc.). Omit for numeric capabilities.
  - comparator — for numeric capabilities ('=', '<', '>', '<=', '>=', '!='). REQUIRED when capability='Custom Attribute' and attribute is set (both must be provided together; omitting comparator causes the condition to render incomplete in RM 5.1 and will throw an error).
  - value — numeric threshold paired with comparator.
  - attribute — for capability='Custom Attribute', the attribute name (e.g., 'humidity', 'energy', any attribute exposed by the device). REQUIRED when using Custom Attribute; must be paired with comparator. Example: {capability:'Custom Attribute', deviceIds:[N], attribute:'water', comparator:'=', state:'empty'}.
  - not — boolean (default false). Set true to invert this condition.
  - rawSettings — escape hatch dict {fieldName: value} for fields not yet mapped above.

Sub-expressions (parens) — for nested expressions like "P1 AND (P2 OR P3)", a condition entry can also be:
  {subExpression: {conditions: [<inner conds>], operator?: 'AND'|'OR'|'XOR', operators?: [...]}}
The walker recursively handles nested sub-expressions of arbitrary depth.

The expression text on mainPage renders as e.g. "Switch1 is on" (single) or "Switch1 is on AND Motion1 is active" (multi). updateRule fires after the expression commits so the rule's evaluator picks up the gate immediately. The cond counter is shared at the Rule Machine parent app's atomicState level (the parent app's id varies per hub) — condition indices may not start at 1 (verified live on the second rule of a session: cond=['2'] is normal, not a bug).

PARTIAL-SUCCESS HANDLING: If `partial: true` in the result, the expression was constructed but some condition fields didn't land.

    validateEnum?: <bool>,                         // when true, reject writes whose value isn't in the input's options list
    hrefContext?: {fromPage, hrefName, hrefParams?, hrefIndex?}  // sub-page state + back-nav target
  }

Operations:
  - introspect: fetch schema; no mutation
  - write: write one field's value (with hrefContext for sub-pages)
  - click: click a regular button (cancelCapab, hasAll, moreCond, etc.)
  - navigate: forward into a sub-page via its href
  - done: BACK-NAVIGATE from a sub-page to its parent via _action_previous=Done. Carries ALL the sub-page's current settings in the form. REQUIRED for sub-pages (Periodic Schedule, etc.) whose parent's row description otherwise renders as "?". Pass hrefContext={fromPage: <parent>, hrefParams: {n: <idx>}} so RM routes correctly.

Recommended driving loop for an LLM:
  1. operation:"introspect" to see what fields the page exposes
  2. operation:"navigate" to enter a sub-page if one is exposed
  3. operation:"write" each required field (with hrefContext on sub-pages)
  4. Inspect diff.appeared / valueEcho.match / silentRejection between writes
  5. operation:"done" to back out of a sub-page (this is what bakes the trigger/action description)
  6. operation:"click" hasAll/actionDone on the parent to finalize the row

Always check `silentRejection`, `valueEcho.match`, and `health.ok` in the response — these are the fail-loud signals."""

                        description: """Add a Rule Machine ACTION to the rule via the high-level structured API. DISCRIMINATOR: use `capability` (NOT `type`) -- callers passing `{type: 'log', ...}` will get "addAction.capability is required (e.g. 'switch'). Common values: switch, dimmer, color, log, notification, runCommand, delay, repeat, ifThen. Pass {discover: true} to get the full structured schema.". Per-capability field specs: docs/rm_action_subtype_schemas.md. Pass `addAction: {discover: true}` to get a structured per-capability schema Map (returns immediately -- no hub mutation, no confirm/backup required). Common capabilities: switch, dimmer, color, colorTemp, lock, thermostat, log, notification, httpGet, httpPost, mode, runCommand, delay, repeat, ifThen -- full list below. Parallel to addTrigger but for the doActPage wizard. The tool orchestrates the full RM 5.1 action-wizard internally -- initializes state.actNdx, discovers the next action index, opens the editor (button=N with the correctly-concatenated stateAttribute=doActN), walks the schema-aware writes for category-specific fields, and commits via actionDone. Returns the assigned action index in result.actionIndex. Caller should still issue a final update_native_app(button='updateRule') after adding all actions to bake the actions[] map and fire initialize().

Capability families and the spec fields each accepts:

  - Switch (capability='switch'):
      action='on'/'off'/'toggle'/'flash' + deviceIds
      action='setPerMode' + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: 'on'|'off', ...}
      action='choosePerMode' + perMode={modeIdOrName: {on: [devIds], off: [devIds]}, ...}
      NOTE: action='flash' starts a flash schedule on devices that
      support .flash() (Hue groups, many Z-Wave/Zigbee dimmer modules).
      RM 5.1 has NO native "stop flash" action subtype — calling
      switch.on/.off afterward does NOT cancel the flash schedule. To
      stop a running flash from within a rule, use capability='runCommand'
      (documented below) with command='flashOff' on the same device list.

  - Dimmer (capability='dimmer'):
      action='setLevel'   + deviceIds + level (0-100) [required] + optional fadeSeconds
      action='toggle'     + deviceIds + level (0-100) [required — the level to set when toggling from off to on] + optional fadeSeconds
      action='adjust'     + deviceIds + adjustBy (-100..100) [required] + optional fadeSeconds
      action='fade'       + deviceIds + targetLevel [required] + minutes [required] + direction='raise'|'lower' + optional intervalSeconds
      action='stopFade'   (no fields)

      action='stopChanging'    + deviceIds
      action='setLevelPerMode' + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: level, ...} + optional fadeSeconds

  - Color (capability='color', RGBW bulbs):
      action='setColor'    + deviceIds + colorName + optional level
      action='toggleColor' + deviceIds + colorName + optional level
      action='setColorPerMode' + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: {color: 'Red', level: 70}, ...}

  - Color Temperature (capability='colorTemp'):
      action='setColorTemp'    + deviceIds + kelvin + optional level
      action='toggleColorTemp' + deviceIds + kelvin + optional level
      action='fadeColorTemp'   + deviceIds + targetKelvin + minutes + direction
      action='stopColorTempFade'
      action='setColorTempPerMode' + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: {kelvin: 2700, level: 70}, ...}

  - Button (capability='button', capability.pushableButton devices):
      action='push'           + deviceIds + buttonNumber
      action='pushPerMode'    + deviceIds + perMode={modeIdOrName: buttonNumber, ...}
      action='choosePerMode'  + buttonNumber + perMode={modeIdOrName: [deviceIds], ...}

  - Run Custom Action (capability='runCommand'):
      command + deviceIds + capabilityFilter (default 'Switch') + optional parameters=[{type:'NUMBER',value:75},...] + optional useLastEventDevice
      Calls any device-driver command (off/on/setLevel/flashOff/refresh/etc.) on the device list. Use this to call commands not exposed by the higher-level capability mappings (e.g. flashOff to stop a flash, custom-driver verbs).

  - File IO (capability='fileWrite' / 'fileAppend' / 'fileDelete'):
      fileWrite   + fileName + content (overwrites)
      fileAppend  + fileName + content (file must already exist; localFile is an enum picker)
      fileDelete  + fileName

  - Z-Wave Polling (capability='zwavePoll'):
      action='start'/'stop' + deviceIds (Z-Wave switches/dimmers only) + target='switches'|'dimmers'

  - Lock (capability='lock'):
      action='lock'/'unlock' + deviceIds

  - Thermostat (capability='thermostat'):
      action= (any) + deviceIds + optional mode/fanMode/heatingSetpoint/
        coolingSetpoint/adjustHeating/adjustCooling

  - Shade/blind (capability='shade'):
      action='open'/'close'/'stop' + deviceIds
      action='setPosition' + deviceIds + position (0-100)

  - Fan (capability='fan'):
      action='setSpeed' + deviceIds + speed (low/med/high/auto/etc.)
      action='cycle'    + deviceIds

  - Mode (capability='mode'):
      action='setMode' + modeId (Integer) or modeName (String)

  - Logging / Messaging:
      capability='log' + message
      capability='notification' + deviceIds + message
      capability='httpGet'  + url
      capability='httpPost' + url + body + optional contentType
      capability='ping'     + ip

  - Music/Sound (capability='volume'/'mute'/'chime'/'siren'):
      capability='volume' + deviceIds + level
      capability='mute'   + action='mute'/'unmute' + deviceIds
      capability='chime'  + deviceIds + optional playStop/soundNumber
      capability='siren'  + deviceIds + optional sirenAction

  - Rules (capability='privateBoolean'/'runRule'/'cancelTimers'/'pauseRule'):
      capability='privateBoolean' + ruleIds + value (Boolean)
      capability='runRule'        + ruleIds   (run actions of named rules)
      capability='cancelTimers'   + ruleIds   (cancel timed actions)
      capability='pauseRule' + action='pause'/'resume' + ruleIds

  - Device control:
      capability='capture'        + deviceIds (capture state)
      capability='restore'                      (restore captured state)
      capability='refresh'        + deviceIds
      capability='poll'           + deviceIds
      capability='disableDevice'  + action='disable'/'enable' + deviceIds

  - Flow control (delay/wait/repeat/exit/comment/conditional):
      capability='delay'         + hours/minutes/seconds + optional cancelable/random   OR  variable=<varName> (variable-sourced seconds)
      capability='delayPerMode'  + perMode={modeIdOrName: {hours, minutes, seconds}, ...}
      capability='cancelDelay'   (no fields)
      capability='exitRule'      (no fields)
      capability='comment'       + text
      capability='repeat'        + hours/minutes/seconds + optional times + stoppable
      capability='stopRepeat'    (no fields)
      capability='repeatWhile'   + expression={conditions:[...], operator?:'AND'|'OR'|'XOR', operators?:[...]} + optional hours/minutes/seconds/times/stoppable
      capability='waitExpression'+ expression={conditions:[...], operator?:..., operators?:[...]} + optional delay={hours,minutes,seconds} + useDuration=true|false
      capability='waitEvents'    + events=[{capability, deviceIds, state, andStays?}, ...]   (LIMIT: only ONE waitEvents action per rule; RM 5.1 stores wait events in global per-rule settings, NOT per-action — adding a second waitEvents action would silently overwrite the first. Combine multiple waits into one action's events array, or split into chained sub-rules.)
      capability='ifThen'        + expression={conditions:[...], operator?:..., operators?:[...]}    (opens IF block; close with 'endIf')
      capability='elseIf'        + expression={...}                                                  (continues IF block; needs preceding 'ifThen')
      capability='else'          (no fields; needs preceding 'ifThen' or 'elseIf')
      capability='endIf'         (no fields; closes the IF block)

  Per-condition shape inside any expression:
    {capability: <RM-condition-cap>, deviceIds?: [<id>], state?: <enum-value>, comparator?: <op>, value?: <num>, attribute?: <name>, not?: true, rawSettings?: {...}}
    Capability options match RM 5.1's IF expression list (Switch, Motion, Contact, Lock, Presence, Mode, etc. — Private Boolean is NOT in the IF list, only in Required Expressions).

Variable-sourced values (works on dimmer.setLevel, delay):
  - dimmer.setLevel: pass `levelVariable: '<hubVarName>'` instead of `level`
  - delay:           pass `variable: '<hubVarName>'` instead of hours/minutes/seconds
  Both write the wizard's uVar=true + xVar=<varName> pair so the value is
  resolved at fire time from a hub variable.

NOT yet mapped (use rawSettings escape hatch with @N placeholder):
  - HSM Arm/Disarm/Cancel All Alerts (separate actSubType not in lockActs dropdown — only appears when HSM is installed and may need a different actType)
  - Garage door open/close (different lockActs subtype, only visible with garage device)
  - Valve open/close (similar)

Optional fields on every spec:
  - delay { hours, minutes, seconds, cancelable } — sets delayAct.<N>='hrs:min:sec' plus duration sub-fields
  - rawSettings { fieldName: value, ... } — escape hatch for advanced fields not yet mapped. Use the literal token '@N' anywhere in a field name to substitute the auto-assigned action index (e.g. {'flashRate.@N': 750}).

Action index is auto-assigned (next available). One addAction call replaces the 6-7 calls of the manual doActPage flow.

Wire-format quirks the helper handles for you (so callers don't need to know):
  1. The 'Create New Action' button (name=N) requires stateAttribute='doActN' (concatenated), not 'doAct'. The Hubitat UI's buttonClick() handler concatenates data-stateAttribute='doAct' + button name 'N' → doActN before POSTing; sending stateAttribute='doAct' alone leaves state.doActN null and doActPage NPEs.
  2. doActPage's schema is incremental: actionDone only appears AFTER all required type-specific fields are set. The helper re-fetches the schema before each write.
  3. selectActions' page hook initializes state.actNdx. On a freshly created rule with zero actions, state.actNdx is null and doActPage renders with actType.null (broken). The helper fires an idempotent empty POST to selectActions FIRST.

PARTIAL-SUCCESS HANDLING: `success: true` means the API call completed and at least one setting was written to the rule (the action skeleton exists). `success: false` means a hard failure -- API errored or nothing was written at all. `partial: true` is ORTHOGONAL to success and means some caller-requested fields didn't land. A `success: true, partial: true` result is the normal partial-success state -- the action row exists, but needs repair. The result includes `repairHints` with concrete next steps. Common repair: 1) update_native_app(walkStep={page:'doActPage', operation:'introspect'}) to see the LIVE schema (settingsSkipped[].available shows what fields ARE present), then write the missing fields one at a time via update_native_app(settings=...). 2) For unrecoverable rows (hubRenderError=true), use removeAction(index:N) to clear the broken action then retry with a different shape. Don't treat `partial: true` as failure -- exhaust tool-only repair before declaring failure."""

/**
 * Extract clickable affordances from raw paragraph HTML into structured data.
 *
 * Background: RM 5.1 (and several other classic SmartApps with multi-step
 * wizards — Room Lighting button-rule editors, Basic Rules condition editor,
 * HPM repository drill-downs, etc.) embed action buttons inside paragraph
 * HTML rather than emitting them as `input.type=button` schema entries.
 * Without extraction, paragraphs like "Create New Trigger Event" appear as
 * stripped plain text in get_app_config — a tool-only LLM has no way to
 * discover the button name (`true`) or the stateAttribute (`moreCond`) it
 * needs to pass to update_native_app, so the entire trigger/action wizard
 * is undriveable from tools alone.
 *
 * Pattern (verified live on firmware 2.5.0.123):
 *   Each clickable affordance is a `<div class='submitOnChange'>` carrying
 *   `title='<HUMAN>'` and optionally `data-stateAttribute='<STATE>'`, with
 *   a paired `<input type='hidden' name='<NAME>.type' value='button'>` in
 *   the same form group. The `<NAME>` prefix on the hidden input is the
 *   button name to POST as `name=<NAME>` against /installedapp/btn (which
 *   is what update_native_app does when given button=<NAME>).
 *
 * Returns a list of maps:
 *   [{name: "true", title: "Create New Trigger", stateAttribute: "moreCond"},
 *    {name: "1",    title: "Edit Trigger",       stateAttribute: "editCond",
 *                   description: "BAT-RM Switch 1, ... any turns on"}, ...]
 *
 * Pairing strategy: collect all hidden button-type inputs in document order,
 * collect all submitOnChange divs in document order, and pair by index. RM
 * always emits them 1:1 for every clickable, so ordinal pairing is reliable.
 * If the counts diverge (a future firmware shape we haven't verified),
 * pairs that exist on both sides still resolve correctly; extras drop.

// (addChildApp('hubitat', 'Rule-5.1', ...) is blocked) by hitting the
// hub's admin-layer endpoints directly via session cookie:
//
//   Create:   GET  /installedapp/createchild/<ns>/<appName>/parent/<pid>  → 302
//   Read:     GET  /installedapp/configure/json/<id>[/<subpage>]
//   Status:   GET  /installedapp/statusJson/<id>
//   Update:   POST /installedapp/update/json  (x-www-form-urlencoded)
//   Button:   POST /installedapp/btn
//   Delete:   GET  /installedapp/forcedelete/<id>/quiet
//
// The capability-multiple contract: multi-device capability inputs need
// THREE paired fields in the same POST (settings[name]=csv, name.type=
// capability.X, name.multiple=true). Omitting `.multiple=true` silently
// rewrites the AppSetting DB flag to false and every subsequent page
// render throws `Command 'size' is not supported by device` against RM's
// list-of-devices code paths. _rmBuildSettingsBody emits the full group
// from the input schema automatically, so callers never have to remember.
//
// Every write is preceded by _rmBackupRuleSnapshot which captures the
// rule's full configure/json + statusJson into File Manager as JSON.
// restore_rm_rule_backup replays the snapshot. This is the "safe to
// experiment" floor the project demands; delete uses soft-delete by
// default so the hub's own rule recovery still works too.

/**
 * walkStep — single-step wizard introspection + write/click/navigate.
 *
 * Designed for LLM-driven dynamic wizard walking. Each call performs at
 * most ONE operation and returns a structured snapshot of how the page
 * changed: schema diff (inputs that appeared/disappeared/changed), the
 * stored-value echo for any write (catches enum case normalization +
 * coercion that the schema wouldn't reveal), sub-page hrefs with their
 * target page, list-count change for actions/triggers (disambiguates
 * "wizard committed cleanly" from "schema went empty because the rule
 * is broken"), and a full health check.
 *
 * Spec shape:
 *   { page: <pageName>,
 *     operation: "introspect" | "write" | "click" | "navigate" | "done",
 *     write?: {<key>: <value>},
 *     click?: {name, stateAttribute?},
 *     navigate?: {targetPage},
 *     validateEnum?: bool,  // if true, reject writes whose value
 *                           // isn't in the input's options list
 *     hrefContext?: {fromPage, hrefName, hrefParams?, hrefIndex?}
 *                           // for sub-page ops + back-nav (done)
 *   }
 *
 * "done" submits the current sub-page back to its parent via
 * _action_previous=Done, carrying ALL current setting values. Required
 * for sub-pages whose parent's row description only renders after a
 * full Done submit (e.g. Periodic Schedule renders "?" without it).
 * Pass hrefContext={fromPage: <parent>, hrefParams: {n: <idx>}} so RM
 * routes the back-nav with the correct paramsForPage.
 *
 * For "introspect" the call only fetches the schema — no mutation. The
 * `before` snapshot is the same as `after` and `diff` is empty.

    // Step 3. Seal the expression with hasRule.
    //
    // BACKGROUND:
    //   walkConds (Step 2) builds AND assembles the expression formula inline:
    //   - Each `cond=a` starts a new condition slot (rCapab_<N>/rDev_<N>/state_<N>).
    //   - Each `oper=<AND|OR|XOR>` write between conditions advances RM's
    //     expression-builder to include that condition in the formula (the oper
    //     picker shown after hasAll is RM's expression-assembly state machine,
    //     not a separate post-processing step).
    //   - By the time walkConds returns, the formula is fully assembled.
    //     Writing additional cond=<idx>/oper pairs AFTER walkConds DUPLICATES
    //     conditions in the formula -- verified live: a 2-condition
    //     AND rule produced "(2 AND 3 AND 3)" when Phase 2 assembly writes were
    //     added after walkConds.
    //
    //   Sub-expressions (cond=b / oper=end-sub-expression) also assemble inline
    //   during walkConds, so the same hasRule-only seal applies for all shapes.
    //   No separate assembly loop is needed for plain or sub-expression shapes.
    //
    //   hasRule SEALS the assembled formula -- without it, conditions render
    //   as "(unused)" in Manage Conditions and the RE evaluates false forever.
    //
    //   WIRE FORMAT (verified live, appUI.js source inspection):
    //   The DOM "Done with Expression" button uses a two-step flow:
    //     1. POST /installedapp/btn  settings[hasRule]=clicked (notify)
    //     2. POST /installedapp/update/json  hasRule=button  (actual commit,
    //        because the button has class=submitOnChange)
    //   writeST routes through _rmWriteSubPageField -> /installedapp/update/json
    //   with settings[hasRule]=button, which is step 2 -- the actual commit
    //   handler.  The /installedapp/btn notify step (step 1) is not needed
    //   because the commit is driven entirely by /installedapp/update/json.
    //   Verified live (app 1779): writeST alone produced
    //   state="complete" with params.unUsed=null on mainPage.
    //
    //   NOTE: STPage's completion button in the JSON schema is named "doneST"
    //   (not "hasRule"). "doneST" is the back-navigation exit button; "hasRule"
    //   is the formula-commit field that RM reads from the update/json payload.
    //   They are separate: hasRule commits, doneST navigates.
    writeST(hrefParams, "hasRule", "button", "hasRule")

    // Step 3b. Click doneST to seal STPage into "Done mode".
    //
    // BACKGROUND:
    //   writeST(hasRule) commits the formula text (state=complete, unUsed=null
    //   on mainPage) BUT leaves STPage in "build mode":
    //     - cond field still has required=true
    //     - no editST / cancelST / stopOnST / evalOnBoot buttons visible
    //
    //   In build mode, any browser navigation using _action_href_name from
    //   STPage triggers jsonSubmit with validate=true, which fails the
    //   required-field check on cond and shows the "Required Fields missing"
    //   popup. The user reported this exactly: opening the rule post-build
    //   and clicking "Manage Conditions" shows the popup.
    //
    //   Clicking doneST via /installedapp/btn transitions STPage to "Done mode":
    //     - cond field disappears (no required=true)
    //     - editST / cancelST / stopOnST / evalOnBoot appear
    //     - doneST is idempotent once in Done mode
    //
    //   Verified live (app 1782):

    //     After doneST:  s0i0 cancelST, s0i1 editST, s0i2 stopOnST, ...
    //     (no required fields anywhere)
    //
    //   doneST is type=button WITHOUT submitOnChange (no changeSubmit needed).

**Exact match rule:**
- If user specifies a device name that EXACTLY matches a device label (case-insensitive OK), use it directly
- Example: User says "turn on Kitchen Light" and device "Kitchen Light" exists → use it

**Non-exact match rule:**
- If no exact match exists, search for similar devices
- Present options to user and WAIT FOR EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION before using any device
- Example: User says "use test switch" but only "Virtual Test Switch" exists → ask "Did you mean 'Virtual Test Switch'?"

**Tool failure rule:**
- If a tool fails (e.g., manage_virtual_device returns an error), report the failure to the user
- Do NOT silently fall back to using existing devices as a workaround
- Example: If creating a virtual device fails, don't just grab an existing device to use instead

**Why this matters:**
- Wrong device could control critical systems (HVAC, locks, security)
- User trust depends on AI only controlling what they explicitly authorized''',

        hub_admin_write: '''## Hub Admin Write Tools - Pre-Flight Checklist

All Hub Admin Write tools require these steps:
1. Backup check: Ensure create_hub_backup was called within the last 24 hours
2. Inform user: Tell them what you're about to do
3. Get confirmation: Wait for explicit "yes", "confirm", or "proceed"
4. Set confirm=true: Pass the confirm parameter

### Tool-Specific Requirements

**reboot_hub** - 1-3 min downtime, all automations stop, scheduled jobs lost, radios restart. Only when user explicitly requests.

**shutdown_hub** - Powers OFF completely, requires physical restart. NOT a reboot. Only when user explicitly requests.

**zwave_repair** - 5-30 min duration, Z-Wave devices may be unresponsive. Best during off-peak hours.

**delete_device** - MOST DESTRUCTIVE, NO UNDO. For ghost/orphaned devices, stale DB records, stuck virtual devices.
- Use get_device to verify correct device
- Warn if recent activity or Z-Wave/Zigbee (do exclusion first)
- All details logged to MCP debug logs for audit

**delete_room** - Devices become unassigned (not deleted). List affected devices first.

**delete_app/delete_driver** - Remove app instances via Hubitat UI first (apps). Change devices to different driver first (drivers). Auto-backs up before deletion.''',

**list_devices:**
- Use detailed=false for initial discovery
- With detailed=true, paginate: 20-30 devices per request
- Make tool calls sequentially, not in parallel
- Server-side label/capability filtering: use labelFilter (substring) and capabilityFilter (exact capability name) instead of fetching all devices and filtering client-side
- format='ids' returns a flat integer array (cheapest for "which devices exist" queries)
- fields=[...] projects named fields only: currentStates and attributes are the expensive ones (per-device hub reads) -- project those out to save hub CPU; capabilities and commands are in-memory and cheap. id is always included regardless of projection. Unknown field names throw.

**get_device_events:**
- Default limit 10, recommended max 50
- Higher values (100+) may cause delays

**get_hub_logs:**
- Default 100 entries, max 500
- Use level and source filters to narrow results

**get_device_history:**
- Up to 7 days of history
- Use attribute filter to reduce data volume''',

        builtin_app_tools: '''## Built-in App Tools

Tools in the manage_installed_apps and manage_native_rules_and_apps gateways have mixed gate requirements. list_installed_apps and get_device_in_use_by require the "Enable Built-in App Tools (read + write)" toggle (requireBuiltinApp). get_app_config, list_app_pages, list_hpm_packages, and get_hpm_drift require Hub Admin Read (requireHubAdminRead). All manage_native_rules_and_apps tools require the "Enable Built-in App Tools" toggle; the CRUD tools (create_native_app / update_native_app / delete_native_app) ALSO require Hub Admin Write. If the user sees "Built-in App Tools are disabled" errors, direct them to the MCP Rule Server app settings page.

**manage_installed_apps (6 tools):**

- **list_installed_apps** — enumerate ALL apps on the hub (built-in + user) with parent/child tree
  - filter="all" (default) | "builtin" | "user" | "disabled" | "parents" | "children"
  - Each entry: id, name, type, disabled, user, hidden, parentId, hasChildren, childCount
  - Built-in apps have user=false (Rule Machine, Room Lighting, Groups and Scenes, Mode Manager, HSM, Dashboards, Maker API, etc.)
  - User apps have user=true (Awair, Ecobee, HPM, etc.)
  - Parent/child tree is flattened with parentId pointers. Hidden parents are excluded from output but their children are promoted to the nearest visible ancestor.

- **get_device_in_use_by** — find apps that reference a specific device
  - Use BEFORE deleting a device, disabling a device, or troubleshooting unexpected behavior
  - Returns appsUsing array with each app's id, name (type like "Room Lights" or "Rule-5.1"), label (user-visible), trueLabel (HTML-stripped), disabled
  - Answers "if I delete this device, which automations break?"

- **get_app_config** — read an installed app's configuration page (Hub Admin Read required)
  - Returns app identity (label, type, disabled), config page sections/inputs/values, and child apps
  - Multi-page apps expose sub-pages via pageName. For HPM: use pageName="prefPkgUninstall" for the FULL installed-package list; pageName="prefPkgModify" returns only the subset with optional components; pageName="prefOptions" is the main-menu navigation (no package data). RM 5.x and Room Lighting use a single mainPage (no pageName needed). Call list_app_pages first to discover available page names for any multi-page app.
  - includeSettings=true adds the raw internal settings map (large apps: 500-1000 keys with app-specific encoding)
  - Workflow: list_installed_apps (or list_rm_rules for RM rules specifically -- note that custom_list_rules / custom_get_rule handle only MCP-native rules, not Hubitat's built-in Rule Machine) to find appId, then get_app_config to inspect. For multi-page apps, consider list_app_pages first.

- **list_app_pages** — discover what pageNames a given app accepts (Hub Admin Read required)
  - Input: appId
  - Returns curated page directory for known app types (HPM, RM 5.x, Room Lighting, Mode Manager) plus an introspected primary page for unknown app types
  - Cuts the page-name guessing cycle for multi-page apps. Especially useful for HPM which exposes multiple sub-pages (prefPkgUninstall / prefPkgModify / prefPkgInstall / prefPkgMatchUp) for different operations.

- **list_hpm_packages** — list all packages tracked by Hubitat Package Manager (Hub Admin Read required)
  - Returns each package's name, version, beta flag, author, and component inventory (apps, drivers, files) as HPM last recorded at install or update time
  - Each app/driver entry includes heID (Hubitat internal code ID; null if never installed or removed outside HPM), required flag, and per-component version (if present in manifest)
  - hpmAppId is optional -- auto-discovered from installed apps if omitted
  - Note: list_hpm_packages reads HPM's stored state only; it does NOT re-fetch live manifests from the internet

- **get_hpm_drift** — cross-reference HPM-tracked state against installed apps (Hub Admin Read required)
  - Surfaces missing-required signals (required component with null heID) and orphan-app signals (heID tracked by HPM but app code definition absent from Apps Code -- deleted outside HPM Uninstall)
  - packageFilter (optional): case-insensitive substring match on packageName to limit the check to specific packages
  - Drift detection is heID-presence-only; source-code drift (post-install edits) and orphan-driver detection are not included

**manage_native_rules_and_apps (9 tools) — read, trigger, AND full CRUD on native RM rules:**

RMUtils-based control surface (Built-in App Tools gate only):
- **list_rm_rules** — enumerate Rule Machine rules (RM 4.x + 5.x combined, deduplicated by id)
- **run_rm_rule** — trigger an existing RM rule
  - action="rule" (default): full evaluation (triggers + conditions + actions)
  - action="actions": run actions only, skip conditions
  - action="stop": stop running actions
- **pause_rm_rule** / **resume_rm_rule** — reversible toggle
- **set_rm_rule_boolean** — set private boolean (Boolean or lowercase "true"/"false" only)

Native CRUD (hub admin-layer, additionally requires Hub Admin Write):
- **create_native_app** — create a new empty classic SmartApp (RM 5.1 by default; appType enum covers rule_machine / button_controller / groups_scenes / notifier / visual_rule). Args: appType (default rule_machine), name, confirm. Returns appId. Call update_native_app afterward to populate; or pass triggers=[...] / actions=[...] arrays to populate in one call.
- **update_native_app** — modify any classic SmartApp. Two raw modes (settings (Map) OR button (String)) plus 14 structured shortcuts (addTrigger, addTriggers, addAction, addActions, addRequiredExpression, addLocalVariable, removeAction, clearActions, replaceActions, moveAction, removeTrigger, modifyTrigger, patches, walkStep). Args: appId + one of those shortcut keys, plus optional pageName, stateAttribute, confirm. Auto-backs-up before writing; emits the multiple=true 3-field capability contract automatically. removeTrigger={index:N} deletes a trigger; modifyTrigger={index:N, mods:{state:'...'}} changes the state field of an existing trigger (capability/deviceIds changes require removeTrigger + addTrigger).
- **delete_native_app** — soft delete (default; refuses if children exist) or force=true. Args: appId, force, confirm. Auto-backs-up before deleting.
- **check_rule_health** — read-only health check on any installed app. Args: appId. Returns ok / configPageError / brokenMarkers / multipleFlagPoison / issues.

For READING an RM rule's current state, use **get_app_config** in the manage_installed_apps gateway — it works on any installed app including RM rules and returns the same configPage shape that update_native_app expects to see.

For BACKUP enumeration and restore, use the unified **list_item_backups** + **restore_item_backup** in manage_apps_drivers — RM rule snapshots have type="rm-rule" in those tools' output and restore_item_backup auto-dispatches the rule-restore path.

**Safety model for native CRUD:**
1. Every write is preceded by a full snapshot (configure/json + statusJson) saved to File Manager; the response's backup.backupKey is the restore handle.
2. Multi-device capability inputs (capability.X with multiple=true) require a 3-field POST payload group (settings[name]=csv, name.type=capability.X, name.multiple=true). Omitting name.multiple=true poisons the AppSetting DB flag and every render throws `Command 'size' is not supported by device`. update_native_app emits the full group automatically from the input schema — callers never have to think about this.
3. After every write, the multiple flags in the live appSettings are verified. If any flipped, one automatic retry fires with the full group. Persistent divergence throws and the response surfaces restore_item_backup as the next step.
4. delete is soft by default. Pass force=true only when you know the rule has children you also want gone.

**CRUD workflow example:**
  create_native_app(name="BAT-RM-demo", confirm=true) → {appId: 974, ...}
  get_app_config(appId=974, includeSettings=true) → input schema + current settings
  update_native_app(appId=974, addTrigger={capability: "Switch", deviceIds: [8, 9], state: "on"}, confirm=true)
  update_native_app(appId=974, addAction={capability: "switch", action: "off", deviceIds: [10]}, confirm=true)
  check_rule_health(appId=974) → verify ok=true, no configPageError or brokenMarkers
  delete_native_app(appId=974, force=true, confirm=true) → {backup: {backupKey: "rm-rule_974_..."}}'''
    ]
}
