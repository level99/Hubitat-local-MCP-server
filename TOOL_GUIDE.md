# MCP Tool Guide

Detailed reference for MCP Rule Server tools. Consult this when tool descriptions need clarification.

## Category Gateway Proxy (v0.8.0+)

As of v0.8.0, the server uses **domain-named gateways** to organize 48 lesser-used tools behind 9 gateway tools. The MCP `tools/list` shows 31 items (22 core + 9 gateways). Use `search_tools` to find any tool by natural language query.

**How to use a gateway:**
1. Call the gateway with no arguments to see full parameter schemas for all its tools
2. Call with `tool='<tool_name>'` and `args={...}` to execute a specific tool

**Gateways:** `manage_rules_admin` (5), `manage_hub_variables` (3), `manage_rooms` (5), `manage_destructive_hub_ops` (3), `manage_apps_drivers` (6), `manage_app_driver_code` (7), `manage_logs` (6), `manage_diagnostics` (10), `manage_files` (4)

All safety gates (Hub Admin Read/Write, confirm, backup checks) are preserved — they are enforced in the handler functions, not the dispatch layer.

## Device Authorization (CRITICAL)

**Exact match rule:**
- If user specifies a device name that EXACTLY matches a device label (case-insensitive OK), use it directly
- Example: User says "turn on Kitchen Light" and device "Kitchen Light" exists → use it

**Non-exact match rule:**
- If no exact match exists, search for similar devices
- Present options to user and **wait for explicit confirmation** before using any device
- Example: User says "use test switch" but only "Virtual Test Switch" exists → ask "Did you mean 'Virtual Test Switch'?"

**Tool failure rule:**
- If a tool fails (e.g., `manage_virtual_device` returns an error), report the failure to the user
- Do NOT silently fall back to using existing devices as a workaround
- Example: If creating a virtual device fails, don't just grab an existing device to use instead

**Why this matters:**
- Wrong device could control critical systems (HVAC, locks, security)
- User trust depends on AI only controlling what they explicitly authorized

## Hub Admin Write Tools - Pre-Flight Checklist

All Hub Admin Write tools require these steps:

1. **Backup check**: Ensure `create_hub_backup` was called within the last 24 hours
2. **Inform user**: Tell them what you're about to do
3. **Get confirmation**: Wait for explicit "yes", "confirm", or "proceed"
4. **Set confirm=true**: Pass the confirm parameter

### Tool-Specific Requirements

**reboot_hub** (via `manage_destructive_hub_ops`)
- Effects: 1-3 min downtime, all automations stop, scheduled jobs lost, radios restart
- Only use when user explicitly requests a reboot

**shutdown_hub** (via `manage_destructive_hub_ops`)
- Effects: Powers OFF completely, requires physical restart (unplug/replug)
- This is NOT a reboot - hub stays off until manually restarted
- Only use when user explicitly requests shutdown

**delete_device** (via `manage_destructive_hub_ops`)
- MOST DESTRUCTIVE tool - NO UNDO
- Intended for: ghost/orphaned devices, stale DB records, stuck virtual devices
- Additional steps: Use `get_device` to verify correct device, warn if recent activity
- For Z-Wave/Zigbee: Warn user to do proper exclusion first to avoid ghost nodes
- All device details logged to MCP debug logs for audit

**zwave_repair** (via `manage_diagnostics`)
- Effects: 5-30 min duration, Z-Wave devices may be unresponsive
- Best run during off-peak hours
- Only use when user explicitly requests Z-Wave repair

**delete_room** (via `manage_rooms`)
- Devices become unassigned (not deleted)
- List affected devices to user before proceeding
- Dashboard layouts and automations referencing room may be affected

**delete_app / delete_driver** (via `manage_app_driver_code`)
- Remove app instances via Hubitat UI first (for apps)
- Change devices to different driver first (for drivers)
- Source code auto-backed up before deletion

MCP-managed virtual devices:
- Auto-accessible to all MCP device tools without manual selection
- Appear in Hubitat UI for Maker API, Dashboard, Rule Machine sharing
- Use `manage_virtual_device` (action: "delete") to remove (not `delete_device`)

| room | hub internal API | **Yes** |
| enabled | hub internal API | **Yes** |

**Preferences format:**
```json
{
  "pollInterval": {"type": "number", "value": 30},
  "debugLogging": {"type": "bool", "value": true}
}
```

**Valid preference types:** bool, number, string, enum, decimal, text

**Room assignment:** Use exact room name as it appears in Hubitat (case-sensitive)

## Rule Structure Reference

### Triggers
- `device_event` - Device attribute changes (supports duration for debounce, multi-device via deviceIds array)
- `button_event` - Button pushed/held/doubleTapped
- `time` - Specific time (HH:mm) or sunrise/sunset with offset
- `periodic` - Interval-based
- `mode_change` - Location mode changes
- `hsm_change` - HSM status changes

**Multi-device trigger example:**
```json
{
  "type": "device_event",
  "deviceIds": ["id1", "id2"],
  "attribute": "switch",
  "value": "on",
  "matchMode": "all"
}
```

**Time trigger examples:**
```json
{"type": "time", "time": "08:30"}
{"type": "time", "sunrise": true, "offset": 30}
{"type": "time", "sunset": true, "offset": -15}
```
Offset is in minutes (positive = after, negative = before)

### Conditions
- `device_state` - Current device attribute value
- `device_was` - Device was in state for X seconds
- `time_range` - Time window (supports sunrise/sunset)
- `mode` - Current location mode
- `variable` - Hub variable value
- `days_of_week` - Specific days
- `sun_position` - Sun above/below horizon
- `hsm_status` - Current HSM state

### Actions
- `device_command` - Send command to device
- `toggle_device` - Toggle device state
- `activate_scene` - Activate a scene
- `set_variable` / `set_local_variable` - Set variable value
- `set_mode` - Change location mode
- `set_hsm` - Change HSM state
- `delay` - Wait (with ID for targeted cancel)
- `if_then_else` - Conditional logic
- `cancel_delayed` - Cancel pending delayed actions
- `repeat` - Loop actions
- `stop` - Stop rule execution
- `log` - Log message
- `set_thermostat` - Mode/setpoints/fan
- `http_request` - GET/POST to URL
- `speak` - TTS with optional volume
- `comment` - Documentation only
- `set_valve` - Open/close valve
- `set_fan_speed` - low/medium/high/auto
- `set_shade` - open/close/position
- `variable_math` - Arithmetic on variables (add/subtract/multiply/divide/modulo/set)

---

## App/Driver Code Management

### Reading Source Code
- `get_app_source` / `get_driver_source` support chunked reading for large files
- Large files auto-saved to File Manager as `mcp-source-app-{id}.groovy` or `mcp-source-driver-{id}.groovy`
- Use this saved file with `sourceFile` parameter in update tools

### Updating Code
Three modes available:
1. **source** - Provide full source directly (for files <64KB)
2. **sourceFile** - Read from File Manager file (for large files, avoids cloud limits)
3. **resave** - Re-save current source without changes (recompile, trigger backup)

Auto-backs up before modifying. Rapid edits within 1 hour preserve the original.

### After Installation
- Apps: Add via Apps > Add User App in Hubitat web UI
- Drivers: Can be assigned to devices immediately

---

## Backup System

### Hub Backups
- `create_hub_backup` creates full hub database backup
- Required within 24 hours before any Hub Admin Write operation
- Only Hub Admin Write tool that doesn't require a prior backup

### Source Code Backups (Automatic)
- Created automatically when using update_app_code, update_driver_code, delete_app, delete_driver
- Stored in File Manager as `.groovy` files
- Persist even if MCP uninstalled
- Max 20 kept, oldest pruned
- Rapid edits preserve original (1-hour protection)

### Rule Backups (Automatic)
- `delete_rule` auto-backs up to File Manager as `mcp_rule_backup_<name>_<timestamp>.json`
- Restore via: `read_file` → `import_rule`
- Skip backup for test rules: set `testRule: true` when creating/updating

---

## File Manager

Files stored locally on hub at `http://<HUB_IP>/local/<filename>`

**File name rules:**
- Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`
- No spaces, no leading period
- Valid: `my-config.json`, `backup_2024.txt`
- Invalid: `.hidden`, `my file.txt`, `../escape`

**Chunked reading:**
- Use `offset` and `length` parameters for files >60KB
- Each chunk must be <60KB due to response size limits

---

## Performance Tips

**list_devices:**
- Use `detailed=false` for initial discovery
- With `detailed=true`, paginate: 20-30 devices per request
- Make tool calls sequentially, not in parallel

**get_device_events:**
- Default limit 10, recommended max 50
- Higher values (100+) may cause delays on busy devices

**get_hub_logs:**
- Default 100 entries, max 500
- Use level and source filters to narrow results

**get_device_history:**
- Up to 7 days of history
- Use attribute filter to reduce data volume
